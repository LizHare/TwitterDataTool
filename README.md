# Twitter Data Tool
v. 0.0.1

Current project allows a user to log in - then for the top n users you can pull down the text of their latest m tweets.

That data is then processed into a list of all of the words that appear most often in those tweets. The user can add filters to get a more exact data set and check only on tweets which contain those specified words.

That allows a users to get a sense of what words are used in conjunction with those words for their twitter followers.

This project is mostly for fun but could have potential interesting applications for content creators whose followers determine their income pretty closely and whose interests would be directly applicable.

To build you will need to get your own twitter api key/secret and build your own info.plist
